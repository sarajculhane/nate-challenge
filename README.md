## Nate Web Automation Challenge

This is my submission for the Nate Web Automation challenge, which asks to write a program to navigate the link provided from the first page to final after submitting a form.

### Tech Stack
The following technologies were used primarily:

`Javascript & Node.js`
`Puppeteer` (Node library and Web automation API that works with Node & Chronium)
`Mocha/Chai`  (Testing)

I chose these technologies because of my familarity with JS/Node and used Puppeteer because of it's compatibility with Node and Chrome developer tools. While this was my first time using Puppeteer and I have not tried other popular automation tools, I feel that it's APIs were more than sufficient for the required tasks and appreciated the ease of integrating with my chosen environment. 

Similarly, I used Mocha/Chai because I have some exposure to them previously. 

### Run and Testing

To run the application and the associated tests:

```
npm install
npm start
npm test
```
